# **Abstractive Text Summarization - Transformer Model - NLP**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on generating abstractive summaries from lengthy articles using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Unlike extractive methods that copy text fragments, abstractive summarization understands and paraphrases the content to create concise, meaningful summaries.  

This solution is particularly useful for processing news articles, research papers, and long-form content to quickly grasp key information without reading the entire text.

## **Key Features**  
- Full preprocessing pipeline for input data  
- Implementation of a powerful Transformer-based neural network  
- High-quality, context-aware abstractive summaries  
- Scalable architecture for large datasets  

---

## **Libraries and Tools Used**  
- **Torch**: Deep learning framework for efficient model training  
- **Transformers**: State-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT and GPT  
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data manipulation and handling  
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of performance metrics  

Key highlights of the architecture:  
- **Self-Attention Mechanism:** Helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input text  
- **Positional Encoding:** Maintains sequential relationships between words  
- **Multi-Head Attention:** Improves performance by capturing diverse patterns

## **Potential Applications**  
- News summarization  
- E-commerce product description generation  
- Social media content summarization  
- Automated report generation

## **Project Usage**  
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TarunShankarU/Text Summarization-NLP- Transformer Model
    cd Text Summarization-NLP- Transformer Model
    ```  

2. Install required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```  

3. Run the summarization script:
    ```bash
    python summarize.py --input_file example_article.txt
    ```  

4. View generated summaries in the output file.
